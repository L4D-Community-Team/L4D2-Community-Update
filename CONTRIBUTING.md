# Introduction

Hey there!

We are thrilled that you would like to help. If you ever have a question it is probably addressed below; if not, please [contact](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#Contact) us.

As a community pursuit, everything we do is motivated by passion. Unlike [The Last Stand](https://www.l4d.com/laststand/), we are not officially greenlit for an update. However, we are not going to wait for life to happen to us. With the right amount of persistence and [a lot](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Time) of patience, we aim to get out what we put in.

By participating, you agree to our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Contributor Guidelines

## Submissions

If you are just here to [report a bug](https://github.com/Tsuey/L4D2-Community-Update/issues), then jump to our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

If you are here to submit files, please first consider opening an [issue](https://github.com/Tsuey/L4D2-Community-Update/issues) to ask questions or discuss potentially [subjective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subjective) changes or improvements first.

Once you are ready to commit, you can start by [forking](https://github.com/Tsuey/L4D2-Community-Update/fork) (or copying) this repository, then you can create a branch with your changes. You may then request that your files be added by submitting your branch in a [Pull Request](https://github.com/Tsuey/L4D2-Community-Update/pulls) or PR. You can read more about PR's [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

For every submission, please keep the following in mind:

1. If the repository does not already have the script `*.nut` or text file `*.txt/*.vmt`, please submit the unchanged files as the earliest commits, then your changes.
1. Please contact [Lt. Rocky](https://github.com/ltrockyy) `Lt. Rocky#7341` directly when it comes to model, texture, or other source files. We store all source files separately and cannot accept them here.
1. Valve needs to verify every byte we edit, so every submission must serve some functional utility. Maintenance tasks such as optimization and changelogs are the responsibility of maintainers and owners.
1. For readability, follow prominent format conventions if they have already been established. A good example is Valve's [KeyValue format](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/KeyValues) that encloses everything in double quotes. Optimization might not mean less bytes.
1. Keep changes as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes that are not dependent on each other, consider a separate PR.
1. Please [mark PR's as drafts](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request) if they are not yet ready for review.
1. Finally, write [good commit messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

Again: please consider opening up an [issue](https://github.com/Tsuey/L4D2-Community-Update/issues) for discussion pieces such as [suggestions](https://github.com/Tsuey/L4D2-Community-Update/issues/208) instead of submitting implemented suggestions outright.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with our [Code of Conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md#Inclusivity), or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

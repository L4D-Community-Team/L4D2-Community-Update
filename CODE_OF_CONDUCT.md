# Code of Conduct

## Mission Statement

We aim to propose change to Valve's [Left 4 Dead 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/550/Left_4_Dead_2/) with ingenuity, inclusivity, and integrity.

We are a community pursuit. There is no license or C++ source access involved, and map recompiles are not permitted.

We take our best effort toward serving as a voice for those not here with us, to represent the playerbase as much as possible.

## Inclusivity

While we like to keep things light around here, the following are worth review.

In terms of community participation:

- Trolling, insulting/derogatory/discriminative comments, and personal or political attacks will not be tolerated.
- Show empathy and gracefully accept constructive criticism. We all want what is best for the game and sometimes this will require us to meet others half way.
- Please keep any discussion relevant to the topic matter. Wild tangents can go on the [Steam forums](https://steamcommunity.com/app/550/discussions/0/3083268548812820489/).
- When reporting a vulnerability, please [review our Security Policy](SECURITY.md) before posting.

## Integrity

For the greatest chance of success, we need to be whole and undivided. It is in the best interest of Left 4 Dead 2 and its community to make this work smoothly.

In terms of what goes into the game:

- Always be considerate of different play styles, tastes and balance differences across modes.
- The [least astonishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment) solution is usually going to be the best one when it comes to official changes.
- Workshop addons are important and best efforts will be taken to not break them, or to notify authors if official changes may warrant the risk.
- This is Valve's intellectual property. We are not here to radically alter character or map appearances for established base modes.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers leave the right to remove, edit or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits and issues, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive or harmful.

# Code of Conduct

## Mission Statement

We aim to propose change to Valve's [Left 4 Dead 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/550/Left_4_Dead_2/) with ingenuity, inclusivity, and integrity.

## Ingenuity

We are a community pursuit. There is no license or C++ source access involved, and map recompiles are not permitted.

That does not stop us from proposing code changes that serve an expressed need, sometimes by use of open-source alternatives such as [Alien Swarm](https://github.com/Rayman1103/L4D2Code).

That also does not stop us from using less conventional methods, such as [VScript](https://github.com/Tsuey/L4D2-Community-Update/blob/master/root/scripts/vscripts/community/mapfixes.nut) and [lump files](https://github.com/Tsuey/L4D2-Community-Update/tree/master/root/maps), to fix issues.

If there is no thinking outside the box, we might be doing it wrong.

## Inclusivity

We take our best effort toward serving as a voice for those not here with us, to represent the playerbase as much as possible.

While we like to keep things light around here, the following are worth review.

In terms of community participation:

- Discrimination toward other users based on age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, or religion will not be tolerated.
- Show empathy and gracefully accept constructive criticism. We all want what is best for the game and sometimes this will require us to meet others half way.
- Please keep all [issue](https://github.com/Tsuey/L4D2-Community-Update/issues) or [Pull Request](https://github.com/Tsuey/L4D2-Community-Update/pulls) discussion relevant to the topic matter. Wild tangents can go on the [Steam forums](https://steamcommunity.com/app/550/discussions/0/3083268548812820489/).
- If you are reporting a vulnerability (such as [this one](https://github.com/Tsuey/L4D2-Community-Update/issues/115)), please review [responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure) guidelines and Valve's [HackerOne policy](https://hackerone.com/valve) before posting.

## Integrity

For the greatest chance of success, we need to be whole and undivided. It is in the best interest of Left 4 Dead 2 and its community to make this work smoothly.

In terms of what goes into the game:

- Always be considerate of different play styles, tastes, and balance differences across modes. If you need some ideas, then [look here](https://github.com/Derpduck/L4D2-Comp-Stripper-Rework/wiki/Design-Goals).
- The [least astonishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_astonishment) solution is usually going to be the best one when it comes to official changes.
- Workshop addons are important and best efforts will be taken to not break them, or to notify authors if official changes may warrant the risk. Adding an [unused sound](https://github.com/Tsuey/L4D2-Community-Update/pull/172) for the Grenade Launcher is an example of a small change that was not worth this risk.
- This is Valve's intellectual property. We are not here to radically alter character or map appearances for established base modes.

# Enforcement

In the interest of avoiding [bikeshedding](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/faq/#bikeshed-painting), our [Code of Conduct](#Code-of-Conduct) will be [enforced](https://standardjs.com/#i-disagree-with-rule-x-can-you-change-it).

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that violate our terms of [inclusivity](#Inclusivity), or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Contact

Please do not hesitate to privately ask questions, report instances of abuse, or vulnerabilities to [Rayman1103](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Rayman1103) `Rayman1103#9557`, [shqke](https://steamcommunity.com/id/shqke) `shqke#2172`, or [Tsuey](https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tsuey) `G-Force#7777`.
